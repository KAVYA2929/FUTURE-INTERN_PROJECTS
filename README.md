This repository contains the code, data, and models for the Spam Messenger Detection project. The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model capable of accurately identifying spam messages from legitimate ones in a messaging application. This project involves natural language processing (NLP) techniques, data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

Project Objectives
Data Collection & Preprocessing: Collect and preprocess a dataset of labeled messages, where each message is classified as either "spam" or "ham" (non-spam).
Feature Engineering: Extract meaningful features from the text data using techniques such as TF-IDF, word embeddings, etc.
Model Development: Train and evaluate different machine learning models (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest, etc.) to identify the most effective approach for spam detection.
Model Evaluation: Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model performance.
Deployment: Deploy the best-performing model in a real-time environment using [Flask/Streamlit] for demonstration purposes.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: NLTK, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
Tools: Jupyter Notebooks, Git, Flask/Streamlit (for deployment)
Data Sources: [Mention the dataset used, e.g., SMS Spam Collection dataset]
Project Structure
/data: Contains raw and processed data used for training and testing.
/notebooks: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, feature engineering, and model training.
/scripts: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and prediction.
/models: Saved models and checkpoints.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Required Python libraries (see requirements.txt)
Installation
Clone this repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spam-messenger-detection.git
cd spam-messenger-detection
Install the required dependencies:
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and model training:
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Usage
Training the Model:
Use the notebooks provided in the /notebooks directory to train the model on your data.
Prediction:
Use the trained model to predict whether new messages are spam or not by running the script in /scripts/predict.py.
Deployment:
Deploy the model using Flask/Streamlit for a web-based interface where users can input a message and get a spam/ham prediction.
Evaluation Metrics
The model performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

Accuracy: The percentage of correct predictions out of all predictions.
Precision: The percentage of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions.
Recall: The percentage of true positive predictions out of all actual positives.
F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
